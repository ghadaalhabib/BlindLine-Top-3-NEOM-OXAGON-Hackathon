# BlindLine-Top-3-NEOM-OXAGON-Hackathon
This repository contains the script and dataset used to create the project: BlindLine. BlindLine is an innovative education system for the visually impaired that utilizes computer vision technologies.

It is a ring-like device, with a Raspberry Pi Zero, speaker, and camera, to enable the visually impaired in learning the braille language easily and independently. The camera captures an image of the braille and the speaker translate that braille character to audio. 

It acts to replicate how it is usually done with instructors. Achieving braille literacy can be a daunting task due the extensive supervision required for the learning process as well as a full-time dedicated instructor. Not only there is a shortage of special education institutions, but people living in smaller cities have limited access to necessary resources.
